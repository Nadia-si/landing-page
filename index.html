      Music is one of the most enjoyable human experiences and an ever-present
      companion to people‚Äôs everyday lives. It can improve mood, decrease pain
      and anxiety, and facilitate opportunities for emotional expression.
      Research suggests that music can benefit our physical and mental health in
      numerous ways. Music therapy is used by therapist to enhance conventional
      treatment for a variety of illnesses and disease processes from anxiety,
      depression and stress, to the management of pain and enhancement of
      functioning after degenerative neurologic disorders. Moreover, research
      shows that there are few things that stimulate the brain the way music
      does. So if you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging
      process, listening to or playing music is a great tool. It provides a
      total brain workout.
